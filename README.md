**Black_holes** is a personal project where I try to code multiple light rays
passing by one and eventually multiple black holes in order to visualise clearly
how light bends through the fabric of space-time using Einstein, Schwarzschild 
and many other equations.

In the plots created from the _black_hole.py_ file, there are three components 
to the black hole:

1) The black hole itself, whereby the circumference is the event horizon - the 
boundary where if an event were to happen inside within this radius, it will not
 possible to escape beyond that sphere.
2) Next we have the photon sphere which is 1.5 times the radius of the event 
horizon, and at this radius, light travelling at 299,000 kilometers per second, 
will be in orbit due to the immense gravitational pull. However, this orbit is 
unstable, and so the photons will either spiral inwards towards to the 
singularity, or spiral outwards towards infinity.
3) Lastly, the black hole's 'shadow'. This is the region where if parallel rays 
of light were to travel towards the black hole, then light at 2.6 times the 
event horizon radii will just skim the photon sphere and then end tend to 
infinity.
